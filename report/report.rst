    This report details the design and implementation of an "air drum"
    interactive music program.  Various methods for implementing this on
    consumer hardware utilising a simple webcam are explored.  The results from
    the current implementation are promising with correct strike rates of 87-92%
    achieved with false positives of only 13-30%.  Possible improvements to the
    system are explored for future work.
