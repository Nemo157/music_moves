:abstract: 
    This report details the design and implementation of an "air drum"
    interactive music program.  Various methods for implementing this on
    consumer hardware utilising a simple webcam are explored.  The results from
    this, while not entirely working, are definitely promising.  The marked hand
    tracking worked effectively and the neural net based gesture recognition was
    able to generate a surprisingly high proportion of matches.  Unfortunately
    the initial plan of having a MIDI output that could be connected to an
    actual music program such as GarageBand was sadly not achieved.
